<h1><center>Overview</center></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Growth and innovation are hallmarks of Ocean Discovery Institute's success - and they require taking risks. Whether our students take risks that enable them to realize their potential or our organization ventures to explore growth and replication, we know that risk taking is part of what makes us strong. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Risk can take many forms, including strategic, operational, financial, and compliance. Individually or combined, these risks can jeopardize our financial and operational stability. Proactively assessing, mitigating, and managing risks is the best way to ensure that our students are able to learn and grow in a safe environment and that we can continue to deliver tuition-free programming as a trusted member of our community. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Risk Management is defined as our ability to deliberately and successfully manage risk and negate potential consequences without unnecessarily limiting activities that advance our interests and Ocean Discovery Institute&rsquo;s mission. We acknowledge that Ocean Discovery Institute is subject to certain risks that affect our ability to operate; serve our students, clients, and donors; and protect assets. Risk is inherent to any activity, and it is neither possible, nor advantageous, to entirely eliminate risk from an activity without stopping that activity. Risks that must be managed include those to employees and volunteers, liability to others, property, and our organizational reputation. If risks are not effectively managed there may be substantial costs that are not only financial, but may also include substantial damage to reputation, opportunity costs, potential litigation, distraction from core activities, serious injury, obsolescence, and others. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As such, effective risk management requires a holistic "enterprise" approach supported by shared systems and the active involvement and participation of the entire Ocean Discovery Institute community. Risk Management policies and procedures are embedded throughout the Policy Guide. They are critical to ensuring financial, programmatic, and organizational wellbeing. The Risk Management Policy provides a framework for consistent decision making across the organization and guides the development of related location or department specific policies and procedures. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Risk Management Policy Statements will:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Include provisions and criteria for the use of Risk Management Plans for key activities, projects, or operations, and a reliable means to capture and make available knowledge to improve organizational risk management.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Provide routine assessment which employs a recognized risk management methodology to proactively identify and treat organizational risk.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enable decision making across stakeholders, within areas of responsibility, and escalate with broader organization risk, significant risk, and/or fiduciary impacts.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider the risk in each of the following categories: strategic, compliance, reputational, financial, and operational.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider the activities of all stakeholders, including employees, volunteers, partners, participants, and visitors.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Risk Management Policy Statements:</span></p>

</ol>
</ol>
<p><strong>Procedures</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Risk Management Policy is operationalized through procedures included in the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Risk Management Manual </span></li>
</ul>
<p><br /><strong>Person Accountable for Maintaining Policy and Demonstrating Compliance: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Associate Director</span></p>

<h3><center><em>Policy Statements</em></center></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><em>RM 1.1 Data Privacy</em></p>
<p><strong>RM 1.1.1</strong> <strong>Data Classification</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ocean Discovery trains employees to recognize and protect data based on classification levels: &nbsp;Confidential, Sensitive, and Public. &nbsp;Confidential data of Ocean Discovery Institute is handled only by authorized users and for the purposes required by the job. Confidential data is housed in SaaS secure systems (i.e. Data Propeller Cayen Systems, Raiser&rsquo;s Edge, QuickBooks, Paychex). &nbsp;If at any time Confidential data temporarily lies outside of the SaaS secure system, protective controls (such as encryption, passwords, physical safeguarding, or secure disposal) must be followed. &nbsp;</span></p>

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>RM 1.1.2 Responsibility for Privacy and Confidentiality</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Users who are authorized to obtain data must ensure that it is protected to the extent required by law or Ocean Discovery policy. For example, when high confidential data is transferred from a well-secured system such as Data Propeller Cayen Systems to a user's location, adequate security measures must be in place at the destination computer to protect this data. No information of a confidential, sensitive, or commercially valuable nature belonging to Ocean Discovery should ever be posted on a social networking site. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>RM 1.1.3 Password Protections and Standards</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Passwords are an important aspect of computer security as they are the front line of protection for user accounts. A poorly chosen password may result in a compromise of Ocean Discovery&rsquo;s entire network. As such, all Ocean Discovery staff are responsible for taking the appropriate steps to select and secure their password. &nbsp;Best practices recommended for password construction are: Minimum length of eight (8) characters on all systems; Not be a dictionary word or proper name; Include a number, uppercase, lowercase, and symbol; Not be the same as the User ID; Not be identical to the previous ten (10) passwords; Not follow the same password convention.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Network and application administrator passwords as well as database user passwords must be changed at least every 90 days. &nbsp;For SaaS users, browser password save features must be disabled. &nbsp;All systems level passwords must be part of the IT administered global password management database. The use of an encrypted password storage application is acceptable, although extreme care must be taken to protect access to that application. &nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong>RM 1.1.4 Physical Controls of Hard Copies and Secure Destruction of Paper</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hard copies of confidential must be protected while in transit and at resting place using physical controls. &nbsp;Physical controls may include locked cabinets, financial safes, restricted access storage, or maintaining the item safeguarded in your possession while in use (ex. sealed envelopes or binders temporarily carried). &nbsp;All confidential data which is required to be printed or written is shredded upon disposal.</span></p>

<p><strong>RM 1.1.5 Secure Disposal or Re-use of Equipment </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When equipment is being disposed of, all data on the equipment (e.g. on hard disks or tapes) is physically destroyed prior to leaving the premises for disposal. Ocean Discovery ensures that where electronic media is to be removed from the premises for repair, where possible, the data is securely overwritten.</span></p>
